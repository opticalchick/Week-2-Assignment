<p>Mexico City is rich in culture, art, and history. It is the largest city in the Western Hemisphere; home to more than
    22 million people. With an abundance of parks, flowers, and architecture, there is always something to catch your
    eye. I have included some highlights of our trip.</p><br /><br />
